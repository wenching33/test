Transfer learning using my own data:
Step1:
Prepare my own data and put them in two folders:
-annotations
-images
Step2:
Using tools to transfer them into .tfrecords
Step3: 
Put them into proper folder structure
Models/
  model/
    model.ckpt
Data/
  *.tfrecord
   XXX_lable_map.pbtxt

Step4:
Do training.

Step5:
Export trained model to frozen .pb model

Step6: 
Modify main.py under ~/tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/
(change model path)
& change test images under  ~/tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/test_images/
& run python main.py ==>output wenching*.jpg check it!
